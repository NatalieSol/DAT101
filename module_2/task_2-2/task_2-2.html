      <li>1. Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Constants can be used for values that will remain unchanged. They can help with keeping your code tidy, as you only need to change the value
        in one place, instead of going through yout whole code and change several places. 
        It is also easier for understanding the code if you give your values names, so you know what they are used for instead of having to remember
        every values task.

        Variables can be used for data that possibly can change throughout you coding, such as user input, changes or temporary values that is going
        to be updated. If you use data that can vary, for example database input, you will need to use variables.

        They can not all be constants, because this can cause errors in your program, and to create a dynamic, useable code you will need to have variables.

      <li>2. How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parenthesese make it so that the computer knows what to do first.
			</p>


      <li>3. How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				The method to limit floating-point values to a given number of decimals is to use the toFixed().
			</p>


      <li>4. How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can use Math.abs(a - b) to compare the value of two floating numbers.
			</p>


      <li>5. What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				The comparison operator returns a boolean value wich either comes out as true or false, depending on if the comparison evaluates to true or false. 
        you can check if the statement is true or false by using if-statements. You can also check the result of comparison by logging it. 
        If you want to only check if a comparison is false, you can use the "!".
			</p>


      <li>6. How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				The Math.random() function work by giving the program a value range, f.ex (1 - 100), and it will then choose a value that is inside of that range.
        It can be used for generating a dice roll, if you choose a value between 1 and 6. And many more things random.
			</p>


      <li>7. What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus(%) gives us the rest of a value. For example if you slice a cake in to four pieces and give out to three people, the modulus will then give 
        you the value of what is left of the cake, in this example the answer would be one. 
        You can use it to check if a number is even or odd, the module does this by checking if the number is divisible by 2.
