      <li>[1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[In JavaScript, an array is a data structure that contains multiple values in one single variable. You can access the elements by their index, 
        modify them, and use various built-in methods to manipulate the data. Arrays are essential for handling lists and collections.]</p>

      <li>[2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").]</li>
      <p>[Hard coding means to put the values directly into your code, rather than getting them from external sources. These values will typically be 
        constants. Hard coding can make the program less flexible and difficult to maintain as changes will have to be made directly in to the code. ]</p>

      <li>[3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[To go through this array without knowing the length beforehand we use the method "every". This method will run through each element in the array
        and do a function for each element. The function everyWord will take two parameters; aWord, which is the string in the array.
        and aIndex wich is the index of the array. When we dont know the length of the array we can use a for-loop or imbedded methods like forEach which will automatically go through
        all elements of the array. ]</p>

      <li>[4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[It can be beneficial because it allows you to organize related data together in a well structured way.
        It makes the arrays easy to access and modify. It makes the code easier to use, instead of managing individual variables you can instead use for 
        loops and array operations.]</p>

      <li>[5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)]</li>
      <p>[The EWeekDays object organizes weekdays into key values. The keys in the code in exercise 7 will be represented as WeekDay1, Workdays and Weekends. 
        The values ​​are the objects that contain attributes: the value is set in the numerical representation of the day of the week, while the name is set as a 
        human-readable name of the day of the week. Type is set as additional information such as e.g. "Holiday" for Sunday. The Value attribute uses piecewise attributes 
        to represent individual days or groups of days. These values ​​are powers of 2 in hexadecimal notation (0x01, 0x02, etc.) so they can be uniquely combined using addition or piecewise operations. 
        The difference between "WeekDay", "Workdays" and "Weekends": WeekDay represents a simple day and includes attributes such as value and name. Workdays combine multiple weekdays (Monday-Friday) 
        into a single entry by summing their value attributes. Weekends combines Saturday and Sunday to represent "Weekend. If one wishes to add "WorkoutDays" which includes Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, 
        then you have to combine these days' value attributes (0x01 + 0x03 + 0x08). EWeekDays.WorkoutDays = { value: 0x01 + 0x03 + 0x08, name: "Treningsdager" } Here, these days have been included in WorkoutDays.]</p>

      <li>[6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.]</li>
      <p>[A "callback" is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are commonly used for asynchronous operations, such as handling 
        events or performing tasks after a delay. It can be used to sort an array in different order.]</p>

      <li>[7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.]</li>
      <p>[In sorting routines, the elements of the array are compared two and two to determine which one should come before the other. 
        Each time the routine runs, two elements are compared, and if the first element is greater than the second, they are swapped.]</p>

      <li>[8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains.]</li>
      <p>[The first element of myTable is the first row. A row is an array that contains values ​​for each column in that row.
        The first element of myTable is: ["0.0", "0.1", "0.2", "0.3", "0.4", "0.5", "0.6", "0.7", "0.8"]
        This represents all the cells in the first row,
        where each cell tells which row and column it is in.]</p>
