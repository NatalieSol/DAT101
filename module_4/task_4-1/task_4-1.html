      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>

      <p>[it is a way of programming that makes it easier maintaining a well structured and reusable code. 
        It will allow you to use a specific set of code several times without having to write it new every time.]</p>

      <li>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>

      <p>[The object is used as a container in programming, and represents a set of predefined values that are related to certain categories, configurations or types in systems. 
        It helps in software development in that it improves maintenance, among other things in that if you want to change the name of the account types, you only need to do it 
        in one place (AccountType), then this will be updated in the rest of the program. One also avoids hard-coded strings by using constants such as accountType.SAVINGS, this prevents errors and ensures consistency.
        It also helps improve readability and has all related account types stored in one place for easier viewing and management.]</p>

      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>

      <p>[It is one of the key principles of object-oriented programming, and it focuses on bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together while 
        limiting direct access to some of the object's components. The use of encapsulation provides protection of data, it provides control over access to data 
        and improved maintenance. It is also nice to use to hide complex implementation details to make the class easier to use. ]</p>

      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>

      <p>[This is used to create a new instance of an object based on a "constructor" function or class.]</p>
